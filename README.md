# Snake-Game
The Classic Snake Game.
# Description
The objective is to eat the food and make the snake grow. Snake is controlled by arrow keys and the food appears randomly on the screen.
Upon eating the food, the snake grows in size and the score is increased by one. If the snake collides with the wall or with it's own body, it's game over.
